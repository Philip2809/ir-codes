# ir-codes
IR codes for devices I have laying around.

Use the `irrp.py` to record the IR codes (can also be used to send them). The recorded codes are stored in the `codes.json` file, but I have made irplus files so I can use them with the irplus app on my phone. I found the `irrp.py` script somewhere but can't find where.

`visualize.html` can visualize LIRC codes, but not sure if it is fully correct, mainly a work in progress.

Convereted the LIRC codes to irplus format using IRScrutinizer.

### Devices
- Centrum Titan 500 (also known as Eltax AVR-800)
